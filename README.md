🌍 Earthquake Prediction System
Forecasting seismic activity using Transformer-based time series analysis and real-time data from USGS.

🔍 Overview
This project is focused on predicting earthquakes using real-time seismic data. By leveraging a Time Series Transformer model, we aim to anticipate the likelihood and magnitude of future seismic events. It combines data science, deep learning, and real-world datasets to provide insightful and proactive earthquake predictions.
